# A common problem in coding is having unknown dependencies on variables or 
# packages being used in earlier analysis. This happens when you are running 
# code but do not close R or RStudio between sessions. To reduce the probability
# of this happening you can clear your environmen t of variables, functions and
# packages at the beginning of a script. That way you know your code is only
# running on what is within that script.
# Note: you can reorder a long comment with short-cut Ctrl+Shift+/

# Clear environment of variables and functions
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE)) 

# Clear environmet of packages
if(is.null(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs) == FALSE)lapply(paste(\"package:\", names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs), sep=\"\"), detach, character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
